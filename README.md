# Open-SF (OSF): An Open-Source Project for Multi-PHY Synchronous Flooding Protocols

## Intro

Open-SF (OSF) is an open-source stack for the development of multi-PHY Synchronous Flooding (SF) protocols, presented at [EWSN '22](https://ewsn2022.jku.at/). Based on the [Contiki-NG](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng) low-power operating system, OSF was originally forked from [BlueFlood](https://github.com/iot-chalmers/BlueFlood). Currently OSF only supports the [Nordic nRF52840](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk) (Contiki-NG has support for both the nRF52840-DK and the nRF52840-dongle).

OSF *completely* replaces BlueFlood's polling-based radio driver with an interrupt-based driver, allowing fine-grained timer control of the state machine. Furthermore OSF supports a number of easy-to-use tools for benchmarking and testing with the [D-Cube](https://iti-testbed.tugraz.at/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) low-power wireless testbed.

## OSFv6 (IPv6 Support) and Demo Paper

We have recently added IPv6 support as part of OSF, and will present this in the demo sessions at [EWSN '23](https://events.dimes.unical.it/ewsn2023/). While this has not yet been fully integrated with the original OSF (and so has not yet been merged to main), you can check out the branch [here](https://github.com/open-sf/osf/tree/osfv6).

The OSFv6 demo paper can be found [here](http://www.carloalbertoboano.com/documents/baddeley23osfv6.pdf).

## Features

- Full customization of flooding rounds e.g., NTX, PWR, NSLOTS etc. (including runtime multi-PHY configuration).
- Extension framework for developing SF radio-driver enhancements.
- Extension framework for modifying existing SF protocols.
- Protocol framework for developing new SF protocols.
- One-to-Many dissemination communication.
- Many-to-One collection communication.
- Slot-based channel hopping.
- Robust Flooding (RoF) SF primitive (i.e. Tx-Tx-Tx).
- Glossy SF primitive (i.e. Rx-Tx-Rx).
- Nordic nRF42850 helper for tilix support (Linux only).
- Full support and integration with the [D-Cube](https://iti-testbed.tugraz.at/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) testbed API using [Contiki-NG-DCube](https://github.com/mbaddeley/contiki-ng-dcube).

## Outstanding TODOs

While OSF supports a fair number of features, there are still many things on the TODO list! Feel free to pick up any of the issues, and if you're building on OSF for your own projects then please consider creating a Pull Request :)

## Installation

OSF has been tested and developed on Ubuntu. We strongly recommend using a native Ubuntu installation, and not a VM (unless you know what you are doing with permissions etc.). 

Details on how to install the arm compiler and other tools needed for the nRF boards can be found on the [Contiki-NG Wiki](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/wiki/Platform-nrf52840).

**IMPORTANT** While there are newer compilers available, currently OSF has only been tested using arm-gcc 9. Do not use any other compiler.

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 9-2020-q2-update) 9.3.1 20200408 (release)
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

Additionally you will need to install a number of other programs to run `nrf-helper.sh` (which uses tilix to spawn different child windows for each board.). *N.B. You will need `moreutils` for the `ts` utility, which allows timestamping of the serial.*

```
$ sudo apt install socat moreutils tilix picocom
```

## How to Use

### nrf-helper.sh

You can configure this using the *nrf-helper* tool to automatically generate a deployment mapping of all boards connected to your machine.
```
$ cd tools/nrf
$ ./nrf-helper.sh -info -s -d
```

You can find your board IDs in the deployment mapping generated `os/services/deployment/nulltb/deployment-map-nulltb.c`, or by using following command.
```
$ ./nrf-helper -info
```

You can also use the *nrf-helper* tool to automatically spawn serial terminals if using [tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/).
```
$ sudo apt install tilix
$ tilix
$ cd <path-to-osf>/tools/nrf
$ ./nrf-helper -t
```

### Hello World
OSF contains a simple hello world application that sends and receives messages at the application layer. You can specify the source node with SRC=\* and broadcast to all other nodes with DST=255.

```
$ cd examples/osf
$ make clean TARGET=nrf52840 && make -j16 node.upload-all TARGET=nrf52840 BOARD=dk SRC=1 DST=2 DEPLOYMENT=nulltb HELLO_WORLD=1 PERIOD=1000 CHN=1 LOGGING=1 GPIO=1 LEDS=1 NTX=6 NSLOTS=6 PWR=ZerodBm PROTO=OSF_PROTO_BCAST PHY=PHY_BLE_500K

```

### Testbed Service

For testing purposes, you can use the NULLTB dummy testbed setup in *services/testbed/..* to automatically generate, send, and receive random packet data between boards. This testbed service can also be used to interface with the D-Cube testbed. For more information on this, please check out [Contiki-NG-DCube](https://github.com/mbaddeley/contiki-ng-dcube).

The following command will allow you to compile OSF, flash it to any number of nRF52840-dk boards you have connected to your machine, and observe dummy packets sent from one board (SRC=\*) to all other boards (DST=255).

```
$ cd examples/osf
$ make clean TARGET=nrf52840 && make -j16 node.upload-all TARGET=nrf52840 BOARD=dk SRC=1 DST=255 TESTBED=nulltb DEPLOYMENT=nulltb LENGTH=8 PERIOD=200 CHN=1 LOGGING=1 GPIO=1 LEDS=1 PROTO=OSF_PROTO_BCAST PHY=PHY_BLE_500K
```

### Extension Framework

OSF implements an extension framework to allow straightforward extension of the base driver and/or protocols. A couple of extensions, *random backoff* and *random NTX*, were implemented as part of EWSN '22. Both these extensions significantly improve the performance of the BLE 2M physical layer in dense scenarios, where the uncoded PHYs rarely benefit from capture effects and are significantly impacted by desynchronization.

#### Random BACKOFF

```
make clean TARGET=nrf52840 && make -j16 node.upload-all TARGET=nrf52840 BOARD=dk DST=1 SRC=2,3,4 TESTBED=nulltb DEPLOYMENT=nulltb LENGTH=64 PERIOD=1000 CHN=1 LOGGING=1 GPIO=1 LEDS=1 NTX=6 NSLOTS=6 NTA=4 PWR=ZerodBm PROTO=OSF_PROTO_STA PHY=PHY_BLE_2M BACKOFF=1
```

#### Random NTX

```
make clean TARGET=nrf52840 && make -j16 node.upload-all TARGET=nrf52840 BOARD=dk DST=1 SRC=2,3,4 TESTBED=nulltb DEPLOYMENT=nulltb LENGTH=64 PERIOD=1000 CHN=1 LOGGING=1 GPIO=1 LEDS=1 NTX=6 NSLOTS=12 PWR=ZerodBm PROTO=OSF_PROTO_BCAST PHY=PHY_BLE_2M RNTX=1
```

### Multi-PHY

OSF supports the development of multi-PHY protocols, allowing exploitation of multiple PHYS *in the same protocol*, as well as dynamic selection and (re)configuration of the PHY *at runtime*. OSF provides a na√Øve implementation of such a protocol, the details of which can be found in the [paper](https://michaelbaddeley.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/baddeley2022osf.pdf).

```
make clean TARGET=nrf52840 && make -j16 node.upload-all TARGET=nrf52840 BOARD=dk DST=1 SRC=2,3,4 TESTBED=nulltb DEPLOYMENT=nulltb LENGTH=64 PERIOD=1000 CHN=1 LOGGING=1 GPIO=1 LEDS=1 NTX=6 NSLOTS=6 NTA=4 PWR=ZerodBm PROTO=OSF_PROTO_STA PHY=PHY_BLE_2M MPHY=1
```
